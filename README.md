### Bubble Stack README

### Overview

[Live Demo](https://edwardc148.github.io/Bubble-Stack/)

Bubble stack is a personalized spin-off of the 1995 puzzle video game originally published by Nintendo. The goal is to match all the bubbles of the same colors in order to clear the board.

### Technology

This game is designed to demonstrate Object Oriented Programming in Javascript with the help of HTML 5 Canvas as well as a JavaScript bundler, Webpack.

### Functionality

When Bubble Stack is initialized in the beginning, I make use of the asynchronous nature of JavaScript to put the game into a interval loop that is waiting for user inputs.

Users will be able to shoot bubbles at varying angles in order to match bubbles of at least 3 lengths. The possible colors will be randomly generated and will adapt to varying stages of the game.

### Features



### Sample Code

- Javascript
- HTML 5 Canvas

### Implementation Timeline

Over the weekend:
- [ ] Finish the planning the project
- [ ] Read on Howler.js

Day 1
- [ ] Get the basic functionality of the game running
- [ ] Webpack
- [ ] Build bubble.js (which will hold the properties for the bubbles)

Day 2
- [ ] Setup Howler
- [ ] Bubble collisions

Day 3
- [ ] Setup backend using node

Day 4
- [ ] Heavy CSS day to make everything appropriate and presentable

### Difficulties

The most difficult portion of this project is going to be pattern matching as well as the ability to randomly generate the colors of the bubbles based on what is currently present on the play board screen.  

### Future Direction

- Multiplayer
- Timed mode
